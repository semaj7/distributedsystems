Webservices Mini-Test

1

a)

Request-Line has the Structure:
	'Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF'




4 WS-* Services

a)

The 'Webservice Description Language' (WSDL)-File Defines a Webservice. In case of SunSPOTWebservice the WSDL is stored at
'http://vslab.inf.ethz.ch:8080/SunSPOTWebServices/SunSPOTWebservice?wsdl'

b)

The typedefinitions are imported form schema at 'http://vslab.inf.ethz.ch:8080/SunSPOTWebServices/SunSPOTWebservice?xsd=1' where
	'getSpotResponse' is further defined as type 'sunSpot' which eventually consists of: 
		3 Strings, 2 Switches (String and Boolean), 1 Tilt (3 Doubles).
	'getSpot' consists of a String.


c)

We would use the binding-tag, to bind a porttype to the SMTP-protocol. The SMTP-protocol would be represented by a URI which links to it. The service-address would not have to be changed.
